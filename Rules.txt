Tic tac toe Rules:

1. Player must choose between naught or cross
2. If player has chosen cross then they must make the first move
3. If player has chosen naught then they must wait for the first player (naughts) to make their move
4. Moves are done on a 3 x 3 grid and the player must choose a space inside the grid
5. Once a player has made their move inside the grid then their symbol (either naught or cross) stays on the spot untill the game is finished
6. After the player is done and the symbol is placed inside the grid then the it is the other player's turn to move
7. This must be repeated until either player wins or there is a draw
8. A win is achieved when 3 of the same symbols are placed in a row, this can be either diagonally or horizontally or vertical
9. A draw is achieved when all spaces in the grid have been filled but neither player has 3 of their symbols in a row
